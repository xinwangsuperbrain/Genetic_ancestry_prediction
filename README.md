TrainingPGS_Using_YengoGWAS_includingUKB_inUKBEUR.m

This script trains a polygenic score (PGS) for height in UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. The model uses SNPs identified in the Yengo et al. (2022) height GWAS, which includes European-ancestry samples with UK Biobank participants.

SOLINCA_Height_Prediction_using_PGS_training_inUKBEUR_withYengoGWAS_includingUKB.m

This script applied the height PGS trained from TrainingPGS_Using_YengoGWAS_includingUKB_inUKBEUR.m and incorporating Principal Components (PCs) to HSHC/SOL participants
